## [0.0.0] - 2024-09-13
First version, as described in Mauro S. Maza's doctoral thesis.

### Main features
Intended to simulate 3-bladed LHAWTs, featruring Fernando G. Flores' Simpact FEM software for the structure response, and Cristian Gebhardt's UVLM implementation for aerodynamic load calculation.
Tower is represented with beam elements, while nacelle and hub are represented as concentrated mases (rigid bodies). Blades might be analized with beam elements (GEBT) or with 3-noded shell elements without rotational DoFs.
